# 361Microservice

## How to Request Data: 
1) You can communicate with my microservice via javascript fetch requests as demonstrated in my video. Alternatively, you could use Ajax, JQuery, Axios, etc.
2) The paths for my routes are as follows:
      * In order to get the current user data, use '/'
      * In order to update or add a user, use '/update'
      * In order to delete a user, use '/delete'
3) My microservice runs on port 22333

## How to Receive Data: 
The data coming back for all three routes consists of an array of JSON data which contains users and their sticky note data
